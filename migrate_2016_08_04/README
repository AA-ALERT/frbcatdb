This migration / update is to normalize the database, to add N:N relationships
between the main tables (frbs, observations, radio_obs_params and radio_measured_params)
and the references table via *_have_refs tables

To migrate the frbcat DB to the new schema (as of 20160804) there are two options:

1 - Run ./alter_db.csh . This will make the changes necessary in the DB with schema prior to 20160804

2 - Drop the old DB and create a new one and load the new data and schema with the ../load_db.csh
    Note the ../dump_db.dat has been updated to contain a dump of the Db with the new schema
